## Multi-threading programming:

In ***multi-threading programming***, we have to create multiple threads and each thread is allocated to each operation we want to execute. 

## Asynchronous programming:

On the other hand, in ***asynchronous programming***, we use single thread (main thread) of processor to execute our multiple operations simultaneously.

### Use case:
We use ***multi-threading programming*** when there are CPU-Intensive operations involved in our program and we use ***asynchronous programming*** when there are I/O intensive operations involved in our program.

### Example:
Two friends decided to BBQ at a meetup party. If they divide their tasks and do at the same time, it is multi-threading approach. But if one friend take rest and other is performing task and on the completion of his task, first one start his task that is asynchronous approach.
